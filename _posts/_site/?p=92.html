<p>This book’s authors tried to write an all-around guide for the new coming Java developers.</p>

<p>But Java is too broad to cover all the different topics in just one book.</p>

<p>That’s the main problem with this book: an attempt to include everything that they could in 400 pages.</p>

<p>The book is great! There’s no other book that starts from low-level options of Java NIO and ends with a high-end view on current set of Java web frameworks.</p>

<p>Was it necessary? I doubt.</p>

<p>From my perspective it’s impossible to do what authors intended to do.</p>

<p>Java is a language that has been evolving for more than 15 years. It has an army of adopters, enormous amount of frameworks and a huge set of JVM-based languages.</p>

<p>I bet that you should read this book only if you’re a fresh grad that’s eagerly searches to land on a first job.</p>

<p>I agree with author’s choice of languages and frameworks that they tell about in their book. But is this set crucial for EVERY java developer. I doubt.</p>

<p>My score is 3 of 5</p>
