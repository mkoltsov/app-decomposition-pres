<p><img class="alignleft size-medium" src="https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/images/ansible-for-devops-cover.jpg" width="301" height="391" />I was given this book, which is an uncommon event for me as I usually buy all books by myself. Moreover, I was given a paper version of the book.</p>

<p>Therefore, there were absolutely no regrets regarding this book =) The book is concise and covers almost all parts of Ansible I’ve ever heard of. The only exception was the case when you need to deal with a server that’s under a jump host/bastion, which is very common for cloud deployments as they usually are done in a VPC network of some kind that not exposed to the outer world.</p>

<p>This book has plenty of handful examples, but the most useful thing in it were not them.  The book covers some of the most undervalued parts of the Ansible ecosystem: Ansible Galaxy, Tower and it also has a decent set of invaluable pattern and best practices for writing your playbooks.</p>

<p>My score: 5/5, I’m not sure if you need to read anything more than this book if you plan to use Ansible professionally.</p>
