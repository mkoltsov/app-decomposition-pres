<p><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920041528/cat.gif" width="180" height="236" />I don’t normally buy paper books, which means that in the course of the last few years I’ve bought only one paper book even though I’ve read hundreds of books during that period of time. This book is the second one I’ve bought so far, which means a lot to me. Not mentioning that Google is providing it on the Internet free of charge.</p>

<p>For me, personally, this book is a basis on which a lot of my past assumptions could be argued as viable solutions with the scale of Google. This book is not revealing any Google’s secrets (do they really have any secrets?) But it’s a great start even if you don’t need the scale of Google but want to write robust and failure-resilient apps.</p>

<p>Technical solutions, dealing with the user facing issues, finding peers, on-call support, post-mortems, incident-tracking systems – this book has it all though, as chapters have been written by different people some aspects are more emphasized than the others. I wish some of the chapters had more gory production-based details than they do now.</p>

<p>My score is 5/5</p>
