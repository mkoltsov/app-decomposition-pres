<p>It’s easy to read, though it encompasses lots of useful information. I wish my first Linux book was like that.</p>

<p>The only complaint I had with it was that though its second edition has been recently issued and it wasn’t strictly specified on which Linux distribution should I run some of the commands from the book  I wasn’t able to try some of them due to that there were no such packages in the APT repository for reference Ubuntu Docker image I’ve been using.</p>

<p>This is definitely not a book I would recommend to a SysOps, unless he needs to quickly brush-up his skills. But if you’re a “superuser”, that’s the book you should definitely read to know what’s “inode” any why top&amp;vmstat&amp;iotop might be much more powerful than you’ve thought.</p>

<p>My score 4/5</p>
