I needed a technology that would allow me to build backend as quickly as possible. There were 2 candidates for that: Ruby on Rails and Node.js. I’m not very proficient with Ruby, because of that learning a JavaScript-based technology was the most obvious choice for me.</p>

<p>The book is great. It’s neither small nor large. It has a perfect size of 4 hundred pages that can be easily digested throughout the week. Every chapter has an introductory for those who hadn’t an experience with technology it tells about. I was kinda amused with such small pieces of text about UDP and TCP. I’ve forgot a lot about the basics of what I usually do.</p>

<p>The book is full of small but useful examples from the real life. If you’ll cram through the book at a stallion pace (as I did) for the end of the week you would be able to build a small but full functional websites and back end systems using node.js&amp;REST&amp;NoSql. I did it as a hackathon project for less than 5 hours.</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>
