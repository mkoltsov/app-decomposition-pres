<p>After 2 year pause the most disruptive course i’ve ever attended is offered again. Unfortunately i didn’t finish it last time, which is pretty challenging for me. The course is taught in Scala but most of the concepts are not Scala-specific. If you enjoy functional programming this course will take you to a next level. Recommended by the <a href="http://www.lambdadays.org/" target="_blank">LambdaDays</a>  attendees.</p>

<p>I was told about this course on <a href="http://spark-summit.org/2014" target="_blank">Spark Summit</a> in San Francisco last summer. Spark was invented in Berkeley, therefore i would believe that these guy truly knows what’s Big Data. If you’re curious enough and willing to hone your Python skills i would recommend you to enroll to this course.</p>
