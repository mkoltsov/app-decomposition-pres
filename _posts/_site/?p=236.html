<p>I’ve acted as an organizer &amp; moderator for a great discussion considering the future of AngularJS. It was my first experience of organizing an open-space conference, we didn’t have speakers neither we had a deck of slides. Everyone could share his pain and be able to find relief with help of our community. At the same time we’ve discussed how each of us use Angular. The most common use case was a CRUD application that collects input parameters for some complicated back end application. Most common used backend stack was Spring, next came the Play! Framework, node.JS had the third place.</p>

<p>We’ve discussed how cumbersome was web dev during the age of Jquery dominance, how helpful could be a client-based framework that simply abstracts some of the jquery goodnesses.</p>

<p>I plan to host a GDG event for the next time, because of so much people seem to love the same stuff as myself and I want to share my experience with them.</p>
