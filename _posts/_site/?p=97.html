<p>Here’s a deal that some of the software developers face with on a daily basis. You see someone’s code that you have no idea how to work with. Maybe be because of lack of knowledge/frameworks/time constrains, you choose.</p>

<p>What’s the best practices how to deal with such a problem? You can dig in that code and spend a bunch of time to understand how it works. As you gain more experience you’ll know that there’s another path. As a pragmatic programmer i try to teach myself before i’ll get stuck in an awkward situation.</p>

<p>My problems were couple of frameworks i’ve never used. I didn’t have too much time to learn all about them, so i’ve decided to study them in an easy way. I started to dig myself into Apache Camel.</p>

<p>Packpub is a some sort of a mad publisher. They issued 2 books about Camel this year almost at the same time. I choosed this particular book simply because it was a little bit longer. It has 78 pages!</p>

<p>Ok, this book doesn’t try to teach all the bells and whistles Apache Camel can get you. But it’s a perfect source if you want to start as quickly as possible. The book can be read in a couple of hours! That’s mad! Every chapter has a link if you need to learn something deeper.</p>

<p>My score is 4 of 5</p>
