<p><img class="alignleft" title="cover" src="http://www.cordovaprogramming.com//images/acp-cover-160.png" alt="" width="160" height="209" />I’m learning if Cordova is able to solve the problems I’ve struggled with while developing an app using the native approach of Mobile Development.</p>

<p>I’ve watched a video course on Lynda.com, but it wasn’t a remedy. Screen casts can be easily digested, but I can hardly remember a thing after some time has passed.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve bought this book. Basically, the Cordova programming book disappointed me. The book contains a bunch of examples that can by found on its github repository for free and two hundred and a half pages that are completely useless because all the information they contain can be found on Apache Cordova website for less than nothing.</p>

<p>Actually some tips were useful, but a single blog post would be a more suitable form for them.</p>

<p>My score 2/5</p>
