<p>It was quiet easy to review this book, because i try to re-read it every year and it had became a necessity for me. Some parts of it are not easy to comprehend but at the end of the day this book can teach you what no other book could.</p>

<p>This time i’ve created a <a href="https://github.com/mkoltsov/ConcurrencyInPractice">repository</a> that contains most of the examples. In my experience writing code helps me much more than reading code.</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>
