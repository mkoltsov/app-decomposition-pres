<p>I love meetups! I like to meet new people and learn new things. Last but not least it’s a great opportunity to make new friends.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday we had a third meetup at Luxoft Moscow. This time we’ve talked about web apps full-spectrum testing and how to synchronize the data between a server and a client using the MEAN stack. Andrey Kasatkin did a great talk on how to minimize the data flow using compulsory caching. We’ve talked about <strong>AngularJS, Node.JS, Java, TDD, Selenium, PhantomJS, Scala, highload, patterns of building robust web apps</strong>.</p>

<p>It was really interesting to discuss some things that i’d never thought of, like comparison of concurrency patterns in Java and PHP.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Sysoev">Igor Sysoev</a> who came to our meetup was as solid as rock =)</p>

<p>I believe there’ll be more meetups soon…</p>
