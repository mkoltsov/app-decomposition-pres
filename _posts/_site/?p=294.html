<p>I’ll be giving a talk about the process of developing corporate single page apps next Saturday(20.09) in Kazan.</p>

<p>The talk will be mostly about my experience as a developer, tradeoffs that i had to pay developing “thick web apps” using Angular and lots of its complementary modules. I’ll talk a little bit about developing Rest api that suits most of the corporate restrictions. If there’ll be no backend devs i won’t emphasize on it.</p>

<p>Wish me a good luck!</p>
