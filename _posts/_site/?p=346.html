<p>Every time i’ve been changing some front end code my Grunt build failed because it couldn’t change the corresponding file(i use a highly sophisticated pipeline to compile assets). At first i was thinking that my VCS was the cause of a problem, but that was not the case. Then i find that build fails after the app server runs.</p>

<p>After a couple of wasted hours some serious googling has helped me to find that jetty was in charge!</p>

<p>The jetty:run command <a href="http://appfuse.org/display/APF/FAQ#FAQ-jettyrunlocked">locks the files</a> that you web server is serving to the clients. In case of legacy apps(jsp\jsf) it’s not a problem because static resources got generated on the server. If you’re writing a single-page app(Angular, React all the things) you should be aware of this annoying problem.</p>

<p>The problem can be fixed, but from now on i prefer tomcat in my SBT/MAVEN/GRADLE projects!</p>

<p>p.s. Spring Boot &amp; Grails use Tomcat since the beginning</p>
