<p>Yesterday i was giving a talk summarizing all the new things i’ve learned throughout the conference. It was real fun! I put emphasis onto things i consider as the most prominent : Dart, Polymer, Dataflow. After the talk i had an interesting conversation about the future of AngularJS considering the rise of Polymer. I was a little nervous because i couldn’t see the audience, but the comments and questions were very nice.</p>

<p>I didn’t have enough time to prepare, so i’ve decided to include some of the slides from the conference. Here’s my <a href="http://tiny.cc/aftermathio">presentation</a>.</p>
