These days I ‘ve been struggling a lot because of my incompetence. Many cool JS frameworks (except for jQuery which was a starting point for most of them) and Node.js made me learn JavaScript on a such level that I won’t be shy to show my code to anyone.</p>

<p>In the Java world there’s a book that every pragmatic developer should read , it’s Joshua Bloch’s “Effective Java”. This book has the same uplifting effect, if you would have read it. It teaches how you SHOULD write js code. After reading it I have a strong belief that JavaScript has much more common with Scala and Lisp, than it has with Java.</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>
