<p>I’m not even sure whom this book is dedicated to. If you’re a Scala developer then this book is too outdated due to that most of the APIs it explains are either deprecated of heavily rewritten. If you’re a DevOps… well, you don’t read books at all. You can definitely use it as a reference for some of the SBT commands, but there’re lots of  such references available on the Internet with convenient search by word as well as code examples.</p>

<p>You would definitely find another thing to spend your money on than buying this book.</p>

<p>My score: 2 stars</p>
