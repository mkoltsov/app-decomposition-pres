<p><img class="alignleft" src="https://www.ng-book.com/images/flatbook-ngbook-small.png" alt="cover" width="320" height="421" />I have to admit that this book is the most complete manual for AngularJS. I haven’t had an opportunity to read it from cover to cover, though I use it as a manual very often.</p>

<p>Most of the topics that I’ve referred are well covered. Albeit some of the items are outdated(like a broad coverage of scenario runner which is fully replaced by Protractor) because Angular is extensively improving, it covers most of the topics you’ll ever need to know.</p>

<p>It’s a great manual, but it’s boring. Angular team should replace the demo application with chapters from this book. If you enjoy reading encyclopedias then this book is for you.</p>

<p>My score 3/5 as a book and 5/5 as a reference.</p>
