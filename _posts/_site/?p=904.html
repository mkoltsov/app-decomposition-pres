<p><img class="alignleft " src="https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/7481OS_cov_0.jpg" width="169" height="209" />The book provides only a shallow knowledge of Puppet, doesn’t cover some of the most important modules you’ll need in the real world as well as it doesn’t provide practical examples.</p>

<p>I will recommend it only if you need to quickly brush up the technical details of Puppet’s architecture or you need to start using it quickly rather than spending some time on playing with examples its documentation provides</p>

<p>My score: 3/5</p>
