I needed to take off the ground an Angular-based business application as quickly as possible. I’m a book type of guy, I find it as one of the greatest pleasures to be able to learn from the books. I’ve started learning with some other book, but I ‘ve quickly got bored with it. Next was a nice Pluralsight’s screen cast that has helped me to kickstart my project a lot. Though it was a useful, I’ve needed a solid reference book to address my questions. Without further due I come to this book as a source of true Angular craftsmanship.</p>

<p>The book doesn’t tend to teach you the basics of the framework (which is huge). On contrary it tells you the cases and useful patterns where the framework really shines. At the same time it’s not a pray for Angular, it tells you about the drawbacks and tradeoffs that it has. As a pragmatic developer I would definitely recommend this book for those who strive to obtain a practical knowledge.</p>

<p>My score 4/5</p>
