<p>Finally, i<img class="alignleft" src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/9780596527754/cat.gif" alt="" width="180" height="236" />‘ve read this book! I have a point that i should finish every book that i’ve started to read. This book was an exception, because i wasn’t able to finish it for a few years. I had all sorts of execuses not to read this book, some of them were a lack of time and a complete disinterest in the subject of this book.</p>

<p>I was wrong, the book is interesting. It’s a sort of holy grail for those who want to know how generics work under the hood and where to apply them. As for me i was interested in the second part of it which is “Collections”. It’s nice and comprehensive guide that describes almost every entity in the Java 6 Collections API.</p>

<p>If i have read this books many years ago i would have avoided many pitfalls =)</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>
