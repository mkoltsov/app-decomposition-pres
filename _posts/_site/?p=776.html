<p>As Docker continues to keep its pace as a constantly evolving technology, there’s no book that encompasses all aspects of it. In my opinion, this book came close to that. Though sometimes it doesn’t provide you all technical details it covers a lot of what you need to deal with Docker on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I found the examples that come with the book are so  helpful that even sometimes I could even use them in order to improve some aspects of my daily routine.</p>

<p>The book covers docker 1.8, which API hasn’t changed so much since the book has been written. But some of the networking APIs, docker compose has slightly changed which allows to give this book only 4 stars. Apart from that it’s not  a constantly updated book I can recommend it to anyone who considers Docker as a viable technology.</p>
