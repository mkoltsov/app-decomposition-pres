<p>First of all i should say that i deeply appreciate what Gayle Laakman usually does. Last year i spent a lot of time on her careercup.com website. Also i’ve read another book of her, which is “Cracking the coding interview”. After that don’t blame me if i’m too much biased.&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>What this book is about is obvious if you’ve read it’s title. The book is about how to write a resume to take a job in one of the top-notch tech companies of our time. There’re not so many companies every fresh grad dreams about, but the author promises that after reading this book you would certainly land on an interview in one of them.&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>Is it true? If you’ve reluctantly searched for a job for a year or two this book is definitely not for you. First of all i believe that Gayle’s main audience are not-so-long-graduates or those who search for their first IT job. The main reason for that is a fact that Gayle doesn’t write anything new for an experienced job seekers. Things she says may seem obvious for those who’s got some job experience corollary some experience of searching for a new employer.&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>If you’ve eagerly read all Lifehacker’s and LinkedIn job searching articles for a month or two you would get much more experience in writing a resume. But if you don’t have so much time or your skills seems a bit rusty this book is a perfect resource!&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>It’s doubtfully that you can find all the recipes Gayle Laakman writes in her book in one place. I’m sure you won’t be able to read all these books or articles in a day or two. This book i’ve read for a few days. If you need a quick source for refreshing your job-placing experience i would totally recommend this book to you.</p>
