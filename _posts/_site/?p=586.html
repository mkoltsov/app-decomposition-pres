<p>Unfortunately, th<img class="alignleft" src="http://www.artima.com/images/pins2Cover500x500.gif" alt="" width="225" height="225" />is was not the first book on Scala I’ve read. I wish it was. I also wish that such book for Java would have existed. It provides an inflaming mix of language insights and easy to digest basics of the language. It makes you strive to learn more about the language. It doesn’t provide all you might need for securing a 9 to 5 Scala position after you’ve read it, but it doesn’t even try to be the most comprehensive book of all that are available since it hasn’t been updated for  6 years now. It’s funny to find out that almost 6 years ago XML was as huge as Swing that are considered as outcasts of the past now. A chapter that is solely dedicated to XML? It’s not  that fun if taking into account that the built-in feature for working with XML was considered a huge advantage at the time when Scala was conceived.</p>

<p>I like this book, even though it’s not so relevant now it’s still one of the best all-in-one Scala books that are available on the market.</p>

<p>My score: 5 of 5</p>
