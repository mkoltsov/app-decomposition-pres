<p>This book is a great introduction for those who are real new comers, though I thought of myself as of the same kind.</p>

<p>Turns out that’s not the right book for me as it’s not focused on particular aspects I’m interested in (networking, IO). However, it’s nicely written and it will definitely help if you want to have a high-level view on the most important Bash features.</p>
