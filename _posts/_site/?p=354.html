<p>My major was information security, but since I’ve graduated a lot of things have changed in a field of security. New crypto algorithms have emerged, some of perimeter security patterns have changed. I try to brush up me IS skills from time to time, because I still find security as the most exciting(but not so valued by the managers) thing in IT for me.</p>

<p>This book is not an exception. I’ve been using an open source library which abstracts usage of OAUTH 2.0 and I was curios about the specs that this library is based on.<img class="aligncenter" src="https://playground.theteamie.com/sites/playground.theteamie.com/files/My-Endpoints.png" alt="" width="345" height="308" /></p>

<p>This book is the perfect destination if you’ve come for specs. It covers oauth’12 draft verbosely. Though there are some code snippets written in PHP in Python (which was OK in 2012, but it’s not in 2014 when JS is the most widespread language), they are so brief and out of scope of today’s implementation that I’ll suggest not use them at all.</p>

<p>Albeit the author is a Google employee the book covers some other (mostly Facebook’s) implementations also.</p>

<p>My score is 3/5.</p>

<p>Use this book as a reference, don’t spend much time trying to understand everything from it.</p>
