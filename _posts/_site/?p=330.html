<p><a href="http://www.baeldung.com/rest-with-spring-series/">This</a> 40+ pages manuscript shouldn’t be considered as a book, but it’s author insists to call it so.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/if-java-is-the-engine-then-spring-is-the-fuel.jpg" alt="" width="793" height="681" /> There’s a certain lack of materials covering building a robust Rest API with Spring. Most of the manuals I’ve seen operate with JAX-RS, which Spring MVC doesn’t conform to.</p>

<p>There’s also a great talk by the creator of Apache Shiro which I would recommend to anyone striving to do a scalable web service regardless of particular language/technology you use.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing web services for a long time using different technologies (node, Clojure to name a few). I always try to do it as efficient as I can. This time I had an issue while integrating security layer into Spring MVC.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, this book is a waste of time:</p>

<p>It’s huge, some parts of it are repeating. I have no idea why the author has intended to do so much copy-paste</p>

<p>Some postulates are not true. Though Spring security 3.2 had a java config this book says that it hadn’t.</p>

<p>It doesn’t cover features of Spring 4 at all. The author has forgotten to update his book. Albeit he aggressively promotes it.</p>

<p>For a free ebook it’s not awful, but i would definitely recommend you to find some other book.</p>
