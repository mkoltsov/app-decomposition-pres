<p>My wife needed some Windows specific software on her laptop, so i had to install it. My choice was obvious, because the last OS from Microsoft i’ve used was XP. Installing VirtualBox on Xubuntu -&gt; Downloading XP &amp; Office through MSDN -&gt; Installing it &amp; some minor tweaks took me a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Wow! Windows XP consumes resources next to nothing! Windows 7 &amp; Windows 8 are enormous computer performance suckers! Windows xp can live on 256 mb of RAM! That’s unbelievable!</p>

<p>My final thought is that if you’ll ever need a small windows computer beast consider XP as a perfect candidate!</p>
