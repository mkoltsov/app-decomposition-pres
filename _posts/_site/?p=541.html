<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/images/apache-spark-certified-175x175.png" alt="" width="175" height="175" />Before even starting to prepare for this certification I felt pretty confident that I’m able to secure it without dropping a sweat. After passing the certification I felt that I have been completely wrong since the beginning =)</p>

<p>The reason for my confidence was that I contribute to <a href="http://Spark Packages" target="_blank">spark-packages</a> as well as to some Spark-related OSS projects (i.e. <a href="https://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Zeppelin</a>), apart from the fact that I’m using Spark for more than a year now and I’ve been on the first <a href="https://spark-summit.org/2014/" target="_blank">Spark Summit</a> and a number of Spark-related meetups in London. <img class="alignleft" src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920028512/cat.gif" alt="" width="180" height="236" />I thought that’d be more than enough just to skim a recommended “Learning Spark” book by one of the Spark’s creators before the exam.</p>

<p>I wish I had at least read the impressions of those who’d gone to the exam before me =)</p>

<p>I can definitely say that it’s one of the toughest IT certifications I’ve ever passed. O’reilly &amp; Databricks have really put a lot of emphasis on practical experience that can’t be read anywhere and can’t be constituted without deep digging into the framework internals. I had no experience with Spark on YARN since I was using it mostly on Mesos cluster or in standalone mode, which made me drop a lot of sweat =)</p>

<p>If I had been looking for a new developer with Spark experience I would surely have given him a number of points if he has this certificate. It’s really based on practical experience, but not on theoretical knowledge which makes passing it valuable.</p>
