<p>The book doesn’t try to teach you how_you_should_write_your_software. On contrary it tries to teach you some things that a normal software developer wouldn’t think about. Things like “Mind Reader”, “Daily Hit”, “. You’ve Already Lost Your Job “. I like to think of this book as a set of patterns i would consider highly valuable.</p>

<p>I made a list of that patterns and i’ll try to stick to it =)</p>

<p>My score is 5 out of 5</p>
