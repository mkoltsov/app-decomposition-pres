<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://survivejs.com/assets/img/pure_functions.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" />I set a goal to start being productive with React &amp; its ecosystem throughout a week. As the goal was set I had to find out what will be the best approach to achieve it. Trying to comprehend all these Fluxes, Reduxes &amp; Immutable. JS  through a course of a couple of days seemed impossible to me. Since I’m usually a book-type of guy, at first I’ve decided to read a book … and then BOOM …  i’m a seasoned React pro. <img class="alignleft" src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcShiZEL66bo_F19k_-KX7zVctAPLX4WFoCbsrxwPyrojvtz7Hay" alt="" width="196" height="257" /></p>

<p>To make a long story short, that didn’t happen. This book can definitely help you to comprehend the basics of using a new framework, but these days it’s not sufficient due to so called “Javascript fatigue”, which can be described in simple terms as a never ending flood of JS-frameworks &amp; libraries you need to learn to comprehend a recently written webapp.</p>

<p>The book is good for beginners, for whom it might be their first introduction to the world of modern apps. Learning the basics didn’t give me much since React has a pretty lean learning curve, which doesn’t require anything but any knowledge of Javascript.</p>

<p>The thing that gave me a lot of pain was Redux, which is de-facto standard in writing React apps these days. Unfortunately the book doesn’t contain much about it apart from its mentioning as well as a link to a Github repo with an app written with Redux in mind.</p>

<p><a href="http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html" target="_blank">This</a> manual has helped me more, but to be fair, it’s dedicated to Redux(however, it also explains most of the essential React basics you’d need to be productive). I also reckon that it’s much more lengthier than the reviewed book.</p>

<p>As a Scala developer I find React + Redux very exciting. It’s hard to overestimate how important it is to base front-end apps on robust architecture, which Redux+React helps you to do by obliging  you to use some of the best glimpses of Functional programming.</p>
