<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://ebook-dl.com/pictures/books/mesos-in-action-1st-edition-ignazio(www.ebook-dl.com)_Large.jpg" width="164" height="206" />I can recommend this book only to those who’s looking for a very shallow knowledge of Mesos. It covers only the basics, no details, no iternal APIs, a lot of references to the Mesos documentation.</p>

<p>It’s worth reading if you need to quickly refresh your knowledge, besides that it’s worthless. It recommends to do Service discovery within the Mesos cluster by means of HAProxy &amp; Mesos-DNS!!!</p>

<p>My score 3/5, RTFM</p>
