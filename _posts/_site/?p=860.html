I have hardly seen any book that was so boring to read. Most of the book’s CF examples didn’t work for me. Not to mention that some of the services this book is describing have evolved so much that this book will do you more harm than good if you’ll start using those services based on the book.</p>

<p>Apart from the last 4 chapters I reckon that this book could help you quickly brush up your AWS skills.</p>

<p>The last 4 chapters are still relevant. Even though I’d love to see more emphasis on Elastic BeansTalk, as well as it’s a great pity that though the authors have mentioned AWS Lambda&amp;Gateway API that’d preferred to simply ignore it since it wasn’t available in all regions at the time.</p>
