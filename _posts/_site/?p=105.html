The question was asked in a company that makes most of its profits out of Google’s Android technology.</p>

<p>Google gives <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/projects">a lot</a> of its technologies to open source community. But the most interesting thing is the quality of code base in that projects. I’ve seen most of Java libraries brought by the company and they look astonishing!</p>

<p>If you’ve ever heard about such people as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch">Joshua Bloch</a>, Kevin Bourrillion, Chet Haase and Thor Norbye you’d understand why i use Google’s libraries in every project i touch.</p>

<p>Enough blabbing, this book is about one of the Google’s effort to mitigate the age of “Java the language” – Google Guava (formerly Google collections). The book has 142 pages.</p>

<p>Look at the contents:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-google-guava/book#chapter_2">Chapter 2: Basic Guava Utilities</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-google-guava/book#chapter_3">Chapter 3: Functional Programming with Guava</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-google-guava/book#chapter_4">Chapter 4: Working with Collections</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-google-guava/book#chapter_5">Chapter 5: Concurrency</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-google-guava/book#chapter_6">Chapter 6: Guava Cache</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-google-guava/book#chapter_7">Chapter 7: The EventBus Class</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-google-guava/book#chapter_8">Chapter 8: Working with Files</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-google-guava/book#chapter_9">Chapter 9: Odds and Ends</a></p>

<p>Looks clumsy? Yes, it is! Basically the most valuable part of the book are the code examples. The rest will give you the same pleasure as reading JavaDoc.</p>

<p>My score is 2 out of 5.</p>
