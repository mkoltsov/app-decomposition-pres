<p>This is actually the first book about Python I’ve read even though I’ve used it extensively throughout the years.</p>

<p>My perception that this book proves is that Pythonistas are usually not programmers by trade, they’d come to programming either due to a lucky coincidence or by taking a wrong turn on the road of career hopping.</p>

<p>This book has promised to give a broad look on the Python’s ecosystem, it actually delivers on what it promises. But this look is so shallow that I can’t recommend this book for those who’s willing to get a deep dive into Python on a weekend. The technical details it gives look like author’s waving the hands in the air with no actual proof that I’m used to in Scala and Java books.</p>

<p>Good book, but I can’t recommend it to any professional programmer who’s used to technical/programming/mathematical books.</p>

<p>Score 3/5</p>
