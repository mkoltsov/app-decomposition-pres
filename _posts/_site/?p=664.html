<p>Is it still relevant? Yes, it is. Apart from a few chapters that’s dedicated to Actors and collections this book still contains a lot of useful information for an avid Scala-newbie.</p>

<p>Am I kidding? Not really. The explanation of type classes that’s inside of this book is the best that I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t see a reason to read the book from cover to cover I would recommend  to skim through the “Type system” &amp; “Using implicits” chapters. They’re highly comprehensive and will provide you with information that’ll definitely make your life as a Scala developer easier.</p>

<p>My score 4/5</p>
