<p><img class="alignleft " src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/914-sUgELZL.jpg" width="150" height="224" />That was the first non-technical book I’ve read for the last few years. At first I was really struggling to go through the first one hundred pages as I was constantly bored due to absolute lack of any technical details. However, a good book is always a good book even though it’s an IT-concerned novel.</p>

<p>What I like in this book is how it reminds some of the actual projects I’ve worked. I’m not sure whether the final solution that this book presents will be suitable for anyone but still it gives a lot of food for thought how to improve the inner processes and the workflow in any IT organization. If you like “The Deadline” by Tom DeMarco you would love this book.</p>

<p>My score is 3/5, simply because I don’t like novels.</p>
