When i approached “Atomic Scala” for the first time at the end of 2013 i was amazed. I’ve bought &amp; read “Scala for the impatient” by Cay Horstmann up to this time, but i look at every Eckel’s book as a masterpiece. So, i was thrilled to buy and read it.</p>

<p>2014 has ended, but i didn’t do much Scala at that time and i forgot most of the things that i learned about Scala.</p>

<p>Since i try to learn a new programming language every year, i’ve decided to devote this one to learning Scala &amp; Python. I’ve done some things with them in the past, but i haven’t excelled. As 2012 was Objective-C, 2013 was Clojure, 2014 was Coffeescript &amp; Groovy, 2015 is all about Scala &amp; Python for me.</p>

<p>Yeah, what’s about the book you might wonder? The book is easy as pie! Since we have long Christmas holidays i was able to read most of the book throughout the weekend. Exercises are great, they can give you some practical experience with Scala that you strive to have before starting your first project or finding a good OSS to contribute.</p>

<p>Last chapters can be tough sometimes, but the basics are taught brilliantly!</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>
