Hopefully, health is not the issue that I’ve missed. Self-awareness and consciousness have always been a nice thing to have under your belt.</p>

<p>This book helps to improve those skills by giving you a nice reference for all the good things you need to be aware of that might either help you to advance or suffer as a human being.</p>

<p>This book is nothing more than a composition of blog posts, though it gives your a nice system as a set of goals you can follow along with a companion mobile app. In my opinion, it’s much nicer to have good ideas under one cover than scattered around the Internet.</p>

<p>My score 4/5 due to how actual this topic is for myself</p>
