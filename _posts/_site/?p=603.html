<p>Alvin Alexande<img class="alignleft" src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920026914/cat.gif" alt="" width="180" height="236" />r has such a nice blog that almost anyone who has a question that has something to do with Scala will definitely end up getting to his website at least once.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to give his book a try and i didn’t get disappointed. First I thought I would skim through it in a couple of hours due to relatively easy concepts and redundant information that I might  have known before. Unfortunately (luckily?), that didn’t happen.</p>

<p>The book is slightly outdated (who needs Scalatra or pure lift-JSON these days?), though delivers a lot of useful concepts that I’ve happily put under my belt.</p>

<p>My score 4/5</p>

<p>It needs to be updated + I’d like to remove a lot of worthless water that’s poured upon you here and there in  the “Discussion” parts of every chapter.</p>
