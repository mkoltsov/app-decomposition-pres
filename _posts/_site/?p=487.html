<p>I’<img class="alignleft" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61APhXCksuL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="301" />ve read this book twice before, this is my third time and i still find it appealing. I like how this book is written, how the authors describe sophisticated things in simple terms, what baggage of useful knowledge you obtain after you’ve read it.</p>

<p>This book is not so easy to read as other books from the “head first” series. It’s 600+ pages long, sometimes you’ll feel yourself dumb because of complexity of some patterns. But  at the end of the day, after digging through  it you will surely feel enlightened.</p>

<p>Some things are hard to digest, but they would have helped you a lot if you’d known them before. This book must be read by everyone who had ever thought about designing something from scratch.</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>
