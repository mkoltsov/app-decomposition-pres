<p><img class="alignleft" title="cover" src="http://horstmann.com/scala/images/cover.png" alt="" width="254" height="331" />That was the second Cay Horstmann’s book ive read. First one was  <a href="http://horstmann.com/corejsf/" target="_blank">Core Java Server Faces</a> .</p>

<p>What can i cay, this book is great. Scala language  is very friendly for the newcomers, and on the other side it’s very complicated and needs a lot of practice. But it’s almost impossible to tell about all the features of one language in a three hundred pages book. But Cay Horstmann really did that. He doesn’t waste your time on an explanation of basic stuff. He goes straight to the core of Scala.</p>

<p>I read that book in a couple of days. If you need something to teach yourself Scala and you don’t have too much time that’s your perfect solution!</p>
