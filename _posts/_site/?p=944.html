<p>It’s also complimentary to the “Phoenix Project” written by the same authors.</p>

<p>If you’ve skipped the “Phoenix Project” or you don’t like to read the novels, like I do, I would recommend you to start with this book as it has much more momentum than the first book.</p>

<p>It has a bunch of great inspiring examples of successes from the companies that have embarked on the “DevOps journey” which to me is the best part of this book. Also the book is relatively recent therefore a lot of its advices are quite innovative and might be even disturbing to some.</p>

<p>My score 4/5</p>
