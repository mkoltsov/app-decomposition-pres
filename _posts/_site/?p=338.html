<p>I’ve been at Kazan for quite a few times, but never as a conference speaker. I was surprised by the technologies these guys use. I’ve been thinking that Kazan is not so well developed in terms of tech(and startups) amplification as Moscow and Saint Petersburg. I was completely wrong. Most of the attendees were working at a startup or were building their own tech startup. Most often used technologies were Ruby on Rails and Coffeescript. There were only one guy who had confessed that he uses .NET. I was the only person there who had been programming on Lisp. IT community in Kazan is very young definitely =)</p>
