It’s said in the book’s introduction that these two books shouldn’t be considered as rivals though many of theirs topics are the same. Advent of JavaScript, node.js and many cool frameworks made the prior book a bit outdated. This book promises to give you patterns how to write js code in modern and concise way .</p>

<p>It’s not a hipster’s book. Hipsters don’t read books, instead they teach themselves Google and treat software engineering as a topic on Stack overflow. This book is for mature software developers who know that you can’t stay content in learning technology.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact most of all I’ve enjoyed few last chapters of the book. Chapters about concurrency, asynchronous way of thinking and creating loops as well as chapters about functional approach to write robust programs are invaluable!</p>

<p>If you want to feel confidence while writing js code reading this update to “JavaScript: the good parts” is essential.</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>

<p>May be I’m a little bit biased but functional and asynchronous approach to writing programs are two things that I try to sneak in every program that I tackle.</p>
