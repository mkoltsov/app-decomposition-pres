<p>Finally, after numerous hours of usage my classical Technics RP DJ 1210 headphones got tired. Earpads got worn out, they’ve started to fall down from my head.</p>

<p>60zl got this issue sorted out. I’ve ordered new earpads,  unfortunately they are not made out of leather but seem fine.</p>

<p>10 minutes of time spent and my headphones are ready to share their second decade with me!</p>
