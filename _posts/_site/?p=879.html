  <strong>TECHNICAL</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Languages I&#8217;ve used and abused throughout the year:
</p>

<li style="text-align: left;">
  Scala &#8211; 6/10 Nice language, though it needs too much attention in comparison with other languages I know and the code is less beautiful than in Clojure/Lisp, some parts are clunky
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Javascript &#8211; 7/10 Easy to use, refreshed my knowledge of ES6 in a couple of hours, enormous ecosystem, ugly
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Bash &#8211; 4/10 &#8211; After I&#8217;ve started to use bash more it has become a huge disappointment for me as its capabilities are very limited
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Python &#8211; can&#8217;t really put a score for it since I haven&#8217;t really learned it. However, that didn&#8217;t stop me from using it. Nice language, but some parts are really lame and disputable.
</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Technologies:
</p>

<li style="text-align: left;">
  React/Redux &#8211; 7/10 Nice framework, its ubiquitous usage of FP paradigms helps are lot to educate the newcomers. Though I find it less productive than Angular. Nevertheless, it was just this year&#8217;s JS framework that got most of the hype
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Docker &#8211; 10/10 Initially, I was diminishing its importance due to its apparent simplicity and my shallow knowledge of it. But after I wrap by head around it and saw some of its features in integration with other products my mind was blown. <strong>It&#8217;s the technology of the year for me</strong>. I&#8217;m not going ever to install anything on a Vagrant machine myself since there&#8217;s Docker for Mac since this year.
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  AWS &#8211; 7/10 Worked with RDS, Dynamo, CloudFormation, S3 (Scala driver written by enthusiasts sucks), Route53, EC2, ECS, Elastic BeansTalk. I have no idea why would anyone build their own private cloud whatsoever since Amazon has most of the features you need, though at a price.
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Couchbase &#8211; 6/10 Mongo-like in-memory database, works fast, search/aggregation/API is ugly.
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  PostgreSQL &#8211; 8/10 Solid as a rock, has rightfully claimed a space in my heart as a default relational DB I&#8217;d use for my projects. JSON integration works there. Makes MySql irrelevant.
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Spark/AKKA &#8211; 8/10 Cool tech, though sometimes have unpredictable behavior due to inherited complexity from other technologies they&#8217;re built upon
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  SBT/AKKA.NET &#8211; 5/10 Both are having a steep learning curve, though after you&#8217;ve spent your time on learning them are nice. Unfortunately, there&#8217;re other tools/technologies much friendlier/productive for their users.
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Mesos/Marathon &#8211; 8/10 Hard to understand, though unbelievably powerful. Gives you autoscaling/loadbalancing out of the box
</li>
