<p>My major was information security, but since I’ve graduated a lot of things have changed in a field of security. New crypto algorithms have emerged, some of perimeter security patterns have changed. I try to brush up me IS skills from time to time, because I still find security as the most exciting(but not so valued by the managers) thing in IT for me.</p>

<p>This book is not an exception. I’ve been using an open source library which abstracts usage of OAUTH 2.0 and I was curios about the specs that this library is based on.<img class="aligncenter" src="https://playground.theteamie.com/sites/playground.theteamie.com/files/My-Endpoints.png" alt="" width="345" height="308" /></p>

<p>This book is the perfect destination if you’ve come for specs. It covers oauth’12 draft verbosely. Though there are some code snippets written in PHP in Python (which was OK in 2012, but it’s not in 2014 when JS is the most widespread language), they are so brief and out of scope of today’s implementation that I’ll suggest not use them at all.</p>

<p>Albeit the author is a Google employee the book covers some other (mostly Facebook’s) implementations also.</p>

<p>My score is 3/5.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://hcplteenscene.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/three-stars.png" alt="" width="371" height="69" /></p>

<p>Use this book as a reference, don’t spend much time trying to understand everything from it.</p>

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.greenmoonsoftware.com/images/spring-boot-project-logo.png" alt="" width="126" height="126" />I had an annoying bug while migrating some code from Spring Boot to a legacy Spring application.</p>

<p>Every time i’ve been changing some front end code my Grunt build failed because it couldn’t change the corresponding file(i use a highly sophisticated pipeline to compile assets). At first i was thinking that my VCS was the cause of a problem, but that was not the case. Then i find that build fails after the app server runs.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/images/jetty-logo-80x22.png" alt="" width="283" height="80" /></p>

<p>After a couple of wasted hours some serious googling has helped me to find that jetty was in charge!</p>

<p>The jetty:run command <a href="http://appfuse.org/display/APF/FAQ#FAQ-jettyrunlocked">locks the files</a> that you web server is serving to the clients. In case of legacy apps(jsp\jsf) it’s not a problem because static resources got generated on the server. If you’re writing a single-page app(Angular, React all the things) you should be aware of this annoying problem.</p>

<p>The problem can be fixed, but from now on i prefer tomcat in my SBT/MAVEN/GRADLE projects!</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Tomcat-logo.svg/200px-Tomcat-logo.svg.png" alt="" width="200" height="133" /></p>

<p>p.s. Spring Boot &amp; Grails use Tomcat since the beginning</p>

<p>Some serious magic have been <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/239155/" target="_blank">happening at Microsoft</a>.  Windows 10 promises to add a package manager into the previously opensource-hostile OS.</p>

<p>One could install Opera like we do it on our Linux boxes for years. They’ve added apt-get &amp; aptitude!</p>

<p>First I should say that this book is not a step by step manual for acquiring a job at Google. It’s more an updated version of the author’s previous book “How to move mount Fuji”. This book is full of mind-blowing puzzles and quizzes that the top notch tech companies use to ask during their interviews. At the same time it’s not an encyclopedia, it gives you an exciting insight of the interview process at Google. The author had spent a lot of time interviewing recruiters/interviewers/interviewees to get to a point where he can explain why the interviews have become what they are.</p>

<p>The book is really interesting from scientific point of view, you can get there answers to many rhetoric questions that were asked centuries ago. My favorite question was asked by Newton :”Where a man can swim faster: through water or syrup?”. It had taken few hundred years to get an answer for this question. This book is full of amazing puzzles like this that would definitely help you to develop your analytical thinking.</p>

<p>The only flaw of this book is a fact that it’s not very practical, you would forget most  what you’d read in a couple of days =)</p>

<p>My score 4/5</p>

<p>I’ve been at Kazan for quite a few times, but never as a conference speaker. I was surprised by the technologies these guys use. I’ve been thinking that Kazan is not so well developed in terms of tech(and startups) amplification as Moscow and Saint Petersburg. I was completely wrong. Most of the attendees were working at a startup or were building their own tech startup. Most often used technologies were Ruby on Rails and Coffeescript. There were only one guy who had confessed that he uses .NET. I was the only person there who had been programming on Lisp. IT community in Kazan is very young definitely =)</p>

<p>I love meetups! I like to meet new people and learn new things. Last but not least it’s a great opportunity to make new friends.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday we had a third meetup at Luxoft Moscow. This time we’ve talked about web apps full-spectrum testing and how to synchronize the data between a server and a client using the MEAN stack. Andrey Kasatkin did a great talk on how to minimize the data flow using compulsory caching. We’ve talked about <strong>AngularJS, Node.JS, Java, TDD, Selenium, PhantomJS, Scala, highload, patterns of building robust web apps</strong>.</p>

<p>It was really interesting to discuss some things that i’d never thought of, like comparison of concurrency patterns in Java and PHP.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Sysoev">Igor Sysoev</a> who came to our meetup was as solid as rock =)</p>

<p>I believe there’ll be more meetups soon…</p>

<p>more info is on our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/WeMakeWeb/events/205101712/">meetup page</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.baeldung.com/rest-with-spring-series/">This</a> 40+ pages manuscript shouldn’t be considered as a book, but it’s author insists to call it so.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/if-java-is-the-engine-then-spring-is-the-fuel.jpg" alt="" width="793" height="681" /> There’s a certain lack of materials covering building a robust Rest API with Spring. Most of the manuals I’ve seen operate with JAX-RS, which Spring MVC doesn’t conform to.</p>

<p>There’s also a great talk by the creator of Apache Shiro which I would recommend to anyone striving to do a scalable web service regardless of particular language/technology you use.</p>

<p>I’ve been doing web services for a long time using different technologies (node, Clojure to name a few). I always try to do it as efficient as I can. This time I had an issue while integrating security layer into Spring MVC.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, this book is a waste of time:</p>

<p>It’s huge, some parts of it are repeating. I have no idea why the author has intended to do so much copy-paste</p>

<p>Some postulates are not true. Though Spring security 3.2 had a java config this book says that it hadn’t.</p>

<p>It doesn’t cover features of Spring 4 at all. The author has forgotten to update his book. Albeit he aggressively promotes it.</p>

<p>For a free ebook it’s not awful, but i would definitely recommend you to find some other book.</p>

            <p><img class="alignleft" src="https://www.ng-book.com/images/flatbook-ngbook-small.png" alt="cover" width="320" height="421" />I have to admit that this book is the most complete manual for AngularJS. I haven’t had an opportunity to read it from cover to cover, though I use it as a manual very often.</p>

<p>Most of the topics that I’ve referred are well covered. Albeit some of the items are outdated(like a broad coverage of scenario runner which is fully replaced by Protractor) because Angular is extensively improving, it covers most of the topics you’ll ever need to know.</p>

<p>It’s a great manual, but it’s boring. Angular team should replace the demo application with chapters from this book. If you enjoy reading encyclopedias then this book is for you.</p>

<p>My score 3/5 as a book and 5/5 as a reference.</p>
