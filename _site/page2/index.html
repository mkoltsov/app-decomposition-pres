            <p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>GENERAL</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/25220601-michael-koltsov?read_at=2016">Read 12 books</a></li>
  <li>Gave a talk regarding Akka Persistence</li>
  <li>Went from a role in management to a technical developer/DevOps role</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>TECHNICAL</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Languages I&#8217;ve used and abused throughout the year:
</p>

<li style="text-align: left;">
  Scala &#8211; 6/10 Nice language, though it needs too much attention in comparison with other languages I know and the code is less beautiful than in Clojure/Lisp, some parts are clunky
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Javascript &#8211; 7/10 Easy to use, refreshed my knowledge of ES6 in a couple of hours, enormous ecosystem, ugly
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Bash &#8211; 4/10 &#8211; After I&#8217;ve started to use bash more it has become a huge disappointment for me as its capabilities are very limited
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Python &#8211; can&#8217;t really put a score for it since I haven&#8217;t really learned it. However, that didn&#8217;t stop me from using it. Nice language, but some parts are really lame and disputable.
</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Technologies:
</p>

<li style="text-align: left;">
  React/Redux &#8211; 7/10 Nice framework, its ubiquitous usage of FP paradigms helps are lot to educate the newcomers. Though I find it less productive than Angular. Nevertheless, it was just this year&#8217;s JS framework that got most of the hype
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Docker &#8211; 10/10 Initially, I was diminishing its importance due to its apparent simplicity and my shallow knowledge of it. But after I wrap by head around it and saw some of its features in integration with other products my mind was blown. <strong>It&#8217;s the technology of the year for me</strong>. I&#8217;m not going ever to install anything on a Vagrant machine myself since there&#8217;s Docker for Mac since this year.
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  AWS &#8211; 7/10 Worked with RDS, Dynamo, CloudFormation, S3 (Scala driver written by enthusiasts sucks), Route53, EC2, ECS, Elastic BeansTalk. I have no idea why would anyone build their own private cloud whatsoever since Amazon has most of the features you need, though at a price.
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Couchbase &#8211; 6/10 Mongo-like in-memory database, works fast, search/aggregation/API is ugly.
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  PostgreSQL &#8211; 8/10 Solid as a rock, has rightfully claimed a space in my heart as a default relational DB I&#8217;d use for my projects. JSON integration works there. Makes MySql irrelevant.
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Spark/AKKA &#8211; 8/10 Cool tech, though sometimes have unpredictable behavior due to inherited complexity from other technologies they&#8217;re built upon
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  SBT/AKKA.NET &#8211; 5/10 Both are having a steep learning curve, though after you&#8217;ve spent your time on learning them are nice. Unfortunately, there&#8217;re other tools/technologies much friendlier/productive for their users.
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  Mesos/Marathon &#8211; 8/10 Hard to understand, though unbelievably powerful. Gives you autoscaling/loadbalancing out of the box
</li>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Personal</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Went to<strong> </strong>a swimming pool<strong> </strong>once per week</li>
  <li>Taught my daughter swimming</li>
  <li>Went to see 8 countries</li>

<p>This book is a great introduction for those who are real new comers, though I thought of myself as of the same kind.</p>

<p>Turns out that’s not the right book for me as it’s not focused on particular aspects I’m interested in (networking, IO). However, it’s nicely written and it will definitely help if you want to have a high-level view on the most important Bash features.</p>

I know a half of a dozen of different languages, among them I use 3 of them on a daily basis. Even though I’ve started to learn most of them relatively early due to lack of practice and absence of communication with native speakers my accent is thick. I also do a lot of typical mistakes influenced by my native Slavic language (i.e. I miss the nouns most of the time when I use Germanic-based languages).</p>

<p>But what has recently struck me is that if you know more that one foreign language and you use them day-to-day some tumbler in your head switches and suddenly you’re able to absorb new languages by means of pure anticipation and understanding of common principles that all languages are based upon.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the same idea has struck my daughter who’s already multilingual even though she’s only 5. I wonder how many languages will she be able to speak whilst she’ll be my age.</p>

I have hardly seen any book that was so boring to read. Most of the book’s CF examples didn’t work for me. Not to mention that some of the services this book is describing have evolved so much that this book will do you more harm than good if you’ll start using those services based on the book.</p>

<p>Apart from the last 4 chapters I reckon that this book could help you quickly brush up your AWS skills.</p>

<p>The last 4 chapters are still relevant. Even though I’d love to see more emphasis on Elastic BeansTalk, as well as it’s a great pity that though the authors have mentioned AWS Lambda&amp;Gateway API that’d preferred to simply ignore it since it wasn’t available in all regions at the time.</p>

<p>As Docker continues to keep its pace as a constantly evolving technology, there’s no book that encompasses all aspects of it. In my opinion, this book came close to that. Though sometimes it doesn’t provide you all technical details it covers a lot of what you need to deal with Docker on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I found the examples that come with the book are so  helpful that even sometimes I could even use them in order to improve some aspects of my daily routine.</p>

<p>The book covers docker 1.8, which API hasn’t changed so much since the book has been written. But some of the networking APIs, docker compose has slightly changed which allows to give this book only 4 stars. Apart from that it’s not  a constantly updated book I can recommend it to anyone who considers Docker as a viable technology.</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p><img class="alignleft size-medium" src="https://images.manning.com/255/340/resize/book/0/446f79b-bc76-4f03-b638-2bbebf02f406/Roestenburg-AkkainA.png" alt="" width="255" height="320" />I’ve started reading this book as a draft long before it was released. I’ve abandoned it for a while, but this fall it was finally released thus I no other excuse to finally finish reading it.</p>

<p>I need to confess that’s not the first Akka book I’ve read so far. By no means this book covers all the aspects of Akka (which is enormously huge, albeit allows you to write full fledged applications based only on itself). But it is <strong>THE BOOK </strong>I would recommend you to read if you’re interested in Akka right now. The book has been recently updated to reflect the latest changes in  http, persistence and some other modules. Taking into account how quickly does akka keep its pace I would say that after a while without constant updates (which took this book 4 years to get finished) this book could get outdated.</p>

<p>It has the bulk of the info you need to know about Akka to start working with it and get productive. Code that comes on its Github really works (which is rare for books’ code examples) and it can help you get your hands dirty in parts of the AKKA as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>My score is 4/5(I recommend to start reading it right now until it’s too late)</p>
