            <p><img class="alignleft" title="cover" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fdcaf1d7f42525eed62a07cfd145fd55053996dc/687474703a2f2f692e6d696e75732e636f6d2f69626a7665436c65614a7a6c69312e706e67" alt="" width="230" height="300" />This book considered to be a supplement for the “JavaScript: the good parts”. It’s said in the book’s introduction that these two books shouldn’t be considered as rivals though many of theirs topics are the same. Advent of JavaScript, node.js and many cool frameworks made the prior book a bit outdated. This book promises to give you patterns how to write js code in modern and concise way .</p>

<p>It’s not a hipster’s book. Hipsters don’t read books, instead they teach themselves Google and treat software engineering as a topic on Stack overflow. This book is for mature software developers who know that you can’t stay content in learning technology.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact most of all I’ve enjoyed few last chapters of the book. Chapters about concurrency, asynchronous way of thinking and creating loops as well as chapters about functional approach to write robust programs are invaluable!</p>

<p>If you want to feel confidence while writing js code reading this update to “JavaScript: the good parts” is essential.</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>

<p>May be I’m a little bit biased but functional and asynchronous approach to writing programs are two things that I try to sneak in every program that I tackle.</p>

These days I ‘ve been struggling a lot because of my incompetence. Many cool JS frameworks (except for jQuery which was a starting point for most of them) and Node.js made me learn JavaScript on a such level that I won’t be shy to show my code to anyone.</p>

<p>In the Java world there’s a book that every pragmatic developer should read , it’s Joshua Bloch’s “Effective Java”. This book has the same uplifting effect, if you would have read it. It teaches how you SHOULD write js code. After reading it I have a strong belief that JavaScript has much more common with Scala and Lisp, than it has with Java.</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>

I needed to take off the ground an Angular-based business application as quickly as possible. I’m a book type of guy, I find it as one of the greatest pleasures to be able to learn from the books. I’ve started learning with some other book, but I ‘ve quickly got bored with it. Next was a nice Pluralsight’s screen cast that has helped me to kickstart my project a lot. Though it was a useful, I’ve needed a solid reference book to address my questions. Without further due I come to this book as a source of true Angular craftsmanship.</p>

<p>The book doesn’t tend to teach you the basics of the framework (which is huge). On contrary it tells you the cases and useful patterns where the framework really shines. At the same time it’s not a pray for Angular, it tells you about the drawbacks and tradeoffs that it has. As a pragmatic developer I would definitely recommend this book for those who strive to obtain a practical knowledge.</p>

<p>My score 4/5</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p><img class="alignleft" title="cover" src="http://imagery.pragprog.com/products/369/erpgg_xlargecover.jpg?1386706568" alt="" width="190" height="228" />This time my intention to read a book was simple, I was trying to decide if it’s worth developing for Google glass because of the limitations it imposes.</p>

<p>There’s a certain lack of books for the Glass explorers. The fact that this book exists is a delightful exception. The book exactly does what it promises. An ability to develop web apps for Google glass. Though there is a lot of manuals from Google to achieve such a goal, but I feel confident after reading a book that’s not affiliated with a certain vendor. Vendor’s books tend to lie, that’s the main point after years of tackling distinct API’s.</p>

<p>Apart from that the the book is great, it teaches you how to make it with Google glass in a succinct way. It can be easily read in a couple of days. My only issue with it was a lack of material covering the native development process for the goggles. If all you need is mirror api than this book is sufficient, but if you feel pain because of the mirror api handicaps I recommend you to find another book which covers GDK.</p>

<p>My score is 3/5</p>

            <p><img class="alignleft" src="http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/book/2/8/4/professional-node-js-building-javascript-based-scalable-software-400x400-imadg5e2wvtnwjw6.jpeg" alt="" width="310" height="400" />My motivation for reading this book was simple. I needed a technology that would allow me to build backend as quickly as possible. There were 2 candidates for that: Ruby on Rails and Node.js. I’m not very proficient with Ruby, because of that learning a JavaScript-based technology was the most obvious choice for me.</p>

<p>The book is great. It’s neither small nor large. It has a perfect size of 4 hundred pages that can be easily digested throughout the week. Every chapter has an introductory for those who hadn’t an experience with technology it tells about. I was kinda amused with such small pieces of text about UDP and TCP. I’ve forgot a lot about the basics of what I usually do.</p>

<p>The book is full of small but useful examples from the real life. If you’ll cram through the book at a stallion pace (as I did) for the end of the week you would be able to build a small but full functional websites and back end systems using node.js&amp;REST&amp;NoSql. I did it as a hackathon project for less than 5 hours.</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>

<p>I’ve watched a video course on Lynda.com, but it wasn’t a remedy. Screen casts can be easily digested, but I can hardly remember a thing after some time has passed.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve bought this book. Basically, the Cordova programming book disappointed me. The book contains a bunch of examples that can by found on its github repository for free and two hundred and a half pages that are completely useless because all the information they contain can be found on Apache Cordova website for less than nothing.</p>

<p>Actually some tips were useful, but a single blog post would be a more suitable form for them.</p>

<p>My score 2/5</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p><img class="alignleft" src="http://commonsware.com/images/books/android_development.png" alt="cover" width="137" height="177" />This year i’ve tried to give Android as a developmnent platform a second try. Previously i had a harsh experience with it, mostly because of the fact that it’s environment was inmature. Eclipse with it’s sophisticated Android plugin and Ant were not helping me in keeping sanity at all. It was a mess! Everytime i was executing Android’s emulator my Macbook Pro was acting as it was a typewriter with no multitasking at all.</p>

<p>This time everything has changed. Android’s dev  tools became very mature, as well as the Android’s ecosystem.</p>

<p>Basically, i had to start from scratch in the Android learning process. It’s learning curve is very lean, but at the same time Android’s API is very broad and it’s still constantly changing.</p>

<p>This book is a perfect solution, it consists of 2000+ pages! It covers most of the topics i had to deal with. It has a <a href="https://github.com/commonsguy/cw-omnibus" target="_blank">Github</a> repository, which has a enormous broadth of examples! From simple activities to dealing with NDK, this book has a chapter and a code to tackle in.</p>

<p>My only issue with it is the price. Currently it costs more than <a href="http://commonsware.com/Android/" target="_blank">40 bucks</a>, which is kinda huge for an ebook. I had my concerns with it, that’s why i went on with a free outdated version. If i’ll find a way to make some money with Android, i’ll totally buy a full version which is updated with every major Android release!</p>

<p>My score 5/5</p>
